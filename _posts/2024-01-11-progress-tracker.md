<p>A rough look at where I am in this project. Current snapshot, Jan 2024. </p>
<p>I've marked conversations and documents complete, as I have gotten about all the stories I think I can from my Baba, who is currently 97 years old. Any documents relating to home, immigration, etc I have collected. My main task at the moment is digitizing <a href="underoaks.html#records">records</a> obtained from the Polish archives, including births, marriages and deaths in the village from about 1853. I've entered about 450 births into my database, and am at the year 1867. At the same time I am beginning to think about how to turn digital records into a family tree, or timeline, or some other way to present events from the village, not just of my ancestors. I've started this website, and will mark it complete when the major sections are set up. It will be updated after that of course. The "Documented" column means adding the item to the website. "Presented" means sharing it somehow beyond the website, which might not always apply, but for a tree and a creative project I plan to bring this work forward publicly.
