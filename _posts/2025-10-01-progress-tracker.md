<p>Current snapshot, Oct 2025. </p>
<p>I've done some work on the history of the village, and begun envisioning how to creatively present the end result of the project inspired by Library and Archives Canada's artist in residence program. I have not decided whether to begin the tree from the top down or bottom up. Bottom up would start with me, but the downside is that there are gaps and that cousins and others would be hard to put in. Top down would mean going to the beginning of the records, which is where I began digtizing, and would be time consuming but would include all the people in the village.
