A challenge in creating a database of transcribed records is that first and last names are entered in metrical books in various forms. Primarily, the records I have transcribed so far have been in Latin; additionally, surnames are written in gendered form. I have tried to be consistent in my data entry, choosing not to literally transcribe but instead have a unified spelling of a name. Since I'm not paid to do this, I don't worry about transcribing it "wrong". In the end, the records will be more useful to me this way. However, serious data cleaning and merging of variations is still needed once all records are transcribed.

For information and also to aid my work, here is an unsorted table of Latin, Polish, Ukrainian, Ukrainian (transliterated), and English versions of given names. I'm using "ij" for the "i" sound in Ukrainian. It seems like male names gets transformed more often than female ones.
